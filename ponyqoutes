Rainbow Dash:
I could clear the sky in 10 seconds flat!

Nightmare Moon:
Why, am I not royal enough for you? Don't you know who I am?

Pinkie Pie:
Ooh! Ooh! More guessing games! Um... Pokey Smokes! How about Queen Meanie? No! Black Snooty, Black Snooty!

Twilight Sparkle:
All the ponies in this town are CRAZY!

Rainbow Dash:
Are you a SPY?

Derpy:
Muffin...

Big Machintosh:
Ayup.

Applejack:
Don't you use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue!

Fluttershy:
Um, Pinkie Pie... about this party for Gilda; do you really think it's a good idea? I mean...

Pinkie Pie:
Don't you worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda! Your Aunty Pinkie Pie's got it all taken care of!

Fluttershy:
I'm a year older than you.

Trixie:
Well, well, well. It seems we have some “neigh-sayers” in the audience.

Spike:
Is it... ZOMBIES?!

Twilight Sparkle:
Um, not very likely.

Zecora:
Beware! Beware you pony folk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke!

Rarity:
I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt! I've got a real problem...

Pinkie Pie:
You've got a real problem all right, and a banjo is the only answer!

Twilight Sparkle:
Scarf? Check. Saddle? Check. Boots? Check. 'Spike refusing to get up and go back to sleep'? Check. It's a good thing I'm so organized. I'm ready!

Pinkie Pie:
You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes!

Rainbow Dash:
I love fun things!

Pinkie Pie:
She'll become a crazy cat lady!

Twilight Sparkle:
She only has one cat.

Pinkie Pie:
Give her time...

Rarity:
Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?

Rainbow Dash:
No, I just want my dress to be cool.

Rarity:
Do you not like the color?

Rainbow Dash:
The color's fine, just make it look cooler.

Rarity:
Do you not like the shape?

Rainbow Dash:
The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler. It needs to be about 20% cooler.


Rainbow Dash:
Now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one!

Fluttershy:
Yay.

Rainbow Dash:
Ugh. You're going to cheer for me like that? Louder!

Rainbow Dash:
Louder!!

Fluttershy:
Yay!

Rainbow Dash:
LOUDER!!!

Fluttershy:
Yaaay ... too loud?

Sweetie Belle:
That doesn't look like a table...

Scootaloo:
We were making a table?

Fluttershy:
(squeak)

Rarity:
Whining? I am not "whining". I am complaining. Do you want to hear "whining"? (whines obnoxiously) This is whining! Ooohhhh! This harness is too tight! It's going to chafe! Can't you loosen it?! OH! It hurts and it's so rusty! Why didn't you clean it first?! It's gonna leave a stain, and the wagon's getting heavy! Why do I have to pull it?!

Rarity:
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WAAANTED WHINING!!!

Pinkie Pie:
FOREVER!!!

Scootaloo:
It's no use. No matter what we try we always end up without our cutie marks; and surprisingly often covered in tree sap.

Pinkie Pie:
Secrets and lies! It's all secrets and lies with those ponies!

Rainbow Dash:
I'm just glad I haven't been replaced by a bucket of turnips.

Twilight Sparkle:
Huh?

Rainbow Dash:
You don't wanna know.

Fluttershy:
You're ... GOING TO LOVE ME!!!

Spike:
Ugh ... come on, you guys! Let me in!

Rainbow Dash:
Sure thing, Spike!

Rarity:
Heavens, no! We're getting dressed!

Applejack:
‘Dressed’? Um, beg your pardon, Rarity, but we don't normally wear clothes.

Pinkie Pie:
Hold on a second! Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, guys! Chocolate rain!

Discord:
What fun is there in making sense?

Princess Celestia:
Discord is the mischievous spirit of Disharmony. Before my sister and I stood up to him, he ruled Equestria in an eternal state of unrest, and unhappiness. Luna and I saw how miserable life was for Earth ponies, pegasi, and unicorns alike. So after discovering the Elements of Harmony, we combined our power and rose up against him, turning him to stone!

Rainbow Dash:
Aww right, Princess!

Twilight Sparkle:
I never thought it would happen. My friends ... have turned into complete JERKS!

Rarity:
Oh, Fluttershy. Would you be a dear and FLY FASTER, PLEASE?

Fluttershy:
I can't!

Twilight Sparkle:
If you can't catch her, Discord wins!

Fluttershy:
That big ... dumb ... MEANIE!!!!

Rarity:
How in Equestria can she think that tiny patch of cloud is Cloudsdale?

Applejack:
The same way [Discord] got you to think that cheap rock was a bona fide diamond.

Rarity:
...I thought we agreed never to speak of that again.

Twilight Sparkle:
Get back! All of you! This is my book. And I'm going to READ IT!

Sweetie Belle:
I really like her... mane?

Big Macintosh:
Nope.

Rarity:
Out of all things that could happen, this is THE WORST POSSIBLE THING!

Twilight Sparkle:
Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!

Pinkie Pie:
No I'm not, I'm a chicken! BAGAWK!

Twilight Sparkle:
I'm going to do what I do best: lecture her!

Princess Luna:
Ha, ha! The fun has been doubled!

Twilight Sparkle:
Pinkie Pie, aren't you a little old for this?

Pinkie Pie:
Too old for free candy?! NEVER!

Rarity:
Let me guess. Applesauce?

Sweetie Belle:
Nope. Toast!

Pinkie Pie:
I never leave home without my party cannon!

Pinkie Pie:
I'm not giving him cake! I'm ASSAULTING him with cake!

Pinkie Pie:
Hold on to your hooves, I'm about to be BRILLIANT!

 Derpy:
I don't know what went wrong!

Derpy:
You okay Rainbow Dash? Anything I can do to help?

Rainbow Dash:
NO! NOTHING! In the name of Celestia, just sit there and do nothing!

Pinkie Pie:
APPLEJACK!!! YOU PINKIE PROMISED!!!!
